Writing Ansible Playbooks
=========================


Bang was written with the goal of being able to use Ansible playbooks
either with Bang's builtin playbook runner or directly with
``ansible-playbook``.  As such, any working Ansible playbook will
work when referenced in a Bang config.

Refer to `Ansible's playbook documentation
<http://ansible.cc/docs/playbooks.html>`_ for details about writing
the actual playbooks.


Search Path
-----------
Bang looks for any playbooks referenced by a stack configuration file
in a ``playbooks/`` directory that is a peer of the stack
configuration file.  After it has found a playbook, it defers to
Ansible's path resolution logic for all other includes and file
references.

When Ansible searches for modules referenced in a playbook, it allows
for playbook-specific modules to live in a ``library/`` directory
that is a *peer of the playbook YAML file*.  To supplement this
custom module location, Bang sets the Ansible module/library path to
a ``common_modules/`` directory that is a *peer of the stack
configuration file*.  This means that any custom modules that are
used in multiple playbooks (i.e. not just for one specific playbook)
can be stored along with your stack configurations, playbooks,
templates, etc... in the same directory structure.

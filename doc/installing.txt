Installing Bang
===============


Overview
--------
Bang is published in `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and can be
installed via pip::

    pip install bang

However, Bang depends on other libraries for such things as cloud
provider integration and configuration management.  The OpenStack
client libraries in particular have extra dependencies that can be
tricky to install (e.g. `python-reddwarfclient
<https://github.com/stackforge/python-reddwarfclient>`_ depends on
`lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_).


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
... Using System Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::  This will likely upgrade some of your system Python
   packages.  E.g. On a stock Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation, it
   upgrades `boto <https://github.com/boto/boto/>`_.

The benefit of installing Bang into your system Python installation
is that you don't need to build the native extensions in Bang's
dependencies - you can just use the prebuilt packages for your
system.  The following commands will install Bang to your system
Python installation::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-lxml
    sudo pip install bang

... In a Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unfortunately, some of Bang's dependencies have native extensions
that require extra headers and compilation tools.  Install the
build-time dependencies from the Debian/Ubuntu package repos::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

Then install Bang as directed above.

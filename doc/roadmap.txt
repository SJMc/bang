Road Map
========


Some of the feature ideas below will be implemented in bang.  Some
may be better suited for a *bang-utils* project.  They're listed here
so they won't be forgotten along the way.


General Features
----------------
- Add extension/plugin mechanism.  At the moment, the mercurial-style
  (i.e. using an rc-file for registering extensions) is the most
  palatable because it does *not* demand using setuptools, and
  because it allows the user to manage files how they please.

    - The corollary is that the setuptools-style (i.e. entry points
      defined in setup.py) mechanism is *not* desirable.

- Implement ``--dry-run``.
- Validate stack configuration.

    - Check for any build artifacts in the deployment S3 bucket/other
      central storage location.

- Consider replacing python-reddwarf.  It would be nice to get rid of
  the lxml dependency because it's such a chore to install especially
  in virtualenvs.  Ideally, we would not require
  compilers/``build-essential`` on the installation host.

- Integrate with revision control system.

    - Autoincrement *stack version* in config file.
    - Tag any config scope that defines a ``source_code`` attribute.
    - Generate release notes between tags.

- Autoscale servers.


Providers
---------
- Add AWS provider.

    - Add any deployers that don't really apply to less featureful
      public cloud providers.  E.g. SQS, ELB, SNS, etc...

- Rackspace
- HP Cloud

    - DB Security Groups

- Bare-metal
